<h2>Given the sequence of numbers: 3, 4, 9, 2, 5, 8, 2. Make an algorithm that sorts it in ascending order, presenting the sequence obtained after each step.</h2>

  <p>To sort in more detail, here I used the bubbleSort method where the recursion technique is followed.</p>

  <p>An alternative that I normally use in my projects would be the JS sort() method that sorts the elements of the array itself and returns the array.</p>
